Okay, You are a decent Frontent Engineer.
After finished books like
[_JavaScript: the Good Parts_](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742/)
and [_JavaScript Web Applications_](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Web-Applications-Alex-MacCaw/dp/144930351X/),
you probably write js like this:

{% highlight js %}
// wrap my awesome code in an anonymous function call, get clousured!
// yeah, you heared me.
(function() {

    var brian_said = 'hello world',
        ritchie_said_also = 'konicuwa world?';

    // more code
})();
{% endhighlight %}

Then your project gets bigger, you found yourself should get your code modulized
for better trans-page sharing.

{% highlight js %}
// All I need is a tiny little spot to hold my precious data and methods.
// Gollum: My precious...
var Precious = {};

// module one
Precious.mod1 = (function() {
    // no more hello world plz.
    return {
        // exports methods
    }
})();

// module two
Precious.mod2 = (function() {
    // how about ohayo js?
    return {
        // exports methods
    }
})();
{% endhighlight %}

Those pages of your project differs. Some need module 1, 3, 5, some need module 2, 4, 6.
So you split those codes into separate files and load them specifically in the corresponding page.
Your page bottom might looks like this:

{% highlight html %}
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
    <script>var Precious = {};</script>
    <script src="mod1.js"></script>
    <script src="mod2.js"></script>
    <script src="mod3.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

The requirements of that very project changes, a lot. Page A requires module 1, 3, 5 at first,
suddenly in the next day it cries for module 2, 4, 6. Tedious work like changing script tags
starting to take up a great portion of your time.

And it gets worse, modules have dependencies. There will be lots of bugs caused by circumstances like
page `foo` requires module `blah`, so you add it, but blah rquires module `tongue` and you just forgot.

Starting to think that what the frontend egineering world would be if JavaScript had any module system?
SeaJS come rescue.
